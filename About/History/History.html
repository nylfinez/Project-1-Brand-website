                <h2>History:</h2> <!-- History about lorem ipsum -->
                <p>It is widely believed that the history of Lorem Ipsum originates with Cicero in the 1st Century BC and his text <i>De Finibus bonorum et malorum.</i></p>
                <p>This philosophical work, also known as <i>On the Ends of Good and Evil</i>, was split into five books. The Lorem Ipsum we know today is derived from parts of the first book <i>Liber Primus</i> and its discussion on hedonism, the words of which had been altered, added and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin.</p> 
                <p>It is not known exactly when the text gained its current traditional form. However references to the phrase "lorem ipsum" can be found in the 1914 Loeb Classical Library Edition of the <i>De Finibus</i> in sections 32 and 33.</p>
